 * WebDAV and FTP backends, both built on libcurl.
 *
 * They share almost everything: one easy handle per backend, guarded by a lock, with reads done as
 * byte-range requests. They differ only in how a directory is listed (a WebDAV PROPFIND returning
 * XML, versus an FTP LIST returning a text listing) and in how the metadata operations are
 * expressed (HTTP verbs versus FTP commands sent as QUOTE).
 *
 * Neither protocol has a real seek, so a read is a fresh ranged request. That is fine for media,
 * which reads forward, and acceptable for copying; it would be poor for random access, which is
 * why SMB is the better backend where the server offers it.
 *
 * The platform libcurl has FTP compiled in for this (see the note in external/curl/lib/
 * curl_config.h). Its ftp.c also brings the reconnect and PASV handling that makes FTP tolerable
 * over a home network.
