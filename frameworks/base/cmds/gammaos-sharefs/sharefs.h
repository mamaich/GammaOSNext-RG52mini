 * gammaos-sharefs: presents a network share as an ordinary directory.
 *
 * The devices this runs on have no cifs or nfs in the kernel and the kernel cannot be replaced, so
 * a share cannot be mounted the usual way. Instead this daemon speaks the share protocol itself in
 * userspace and exposes the result through FUSE, which the kernel does have (the sdcard volume is
 * already a FUSE mount). Everything above it - the nano file browser, the photo/music/video
 * scanners, the media players, and copying between local and remote - then works on a normal path
 * with no protocol knowledge at all.
 *
 * One process serves one share, mounted at /mnt/shares/<name>. Running a process per share keeps a
 * dead or unreachable server from taking the others down with it.

 * because these are single-user home shares where throughput is bounded by the network anyway.
