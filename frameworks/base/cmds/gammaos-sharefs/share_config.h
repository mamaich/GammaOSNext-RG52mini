 * The share configuration itself: where a share is stored, how its password is encoded, and how a
 * mount is started and stopped.
 *
 * This is split out of the daemon so the nano menu links the same code. A share added in nano and
 * a share added in Settings have to be byte-identical in the properties, and the password in
 * particular has to be encoded the same way or the daemon decrypts rubbish and the mount fails with
 * a confusing "permission denied". One implementation removes that whole class of bug.
 *
 * Settings and TvSettings are Java and cannot link this, so they use
 * com.android.internal.gammaos.GammaShareConfig, which is a deliberate mirror of this file. If the
 * property names or the password encoding change here, change them there too.
