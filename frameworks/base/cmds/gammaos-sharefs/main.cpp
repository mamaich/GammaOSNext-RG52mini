 * It looks that share up in the persist.gammaos.share.<n>.* properties (see share_config.cpp),
 * decrypts its password and mounts it at /mnt/shares/<name>. init restarts it if it dies, so a NAS
 * that goes away and comes back recovers on its own. Those same properties are what the nano menu,
 * Settings and TvSettings all edit, so there is one definition of a share no matter which UI
 * added it.

// caller on precisely the share it must not touch. A child can simply be killed and, since being
// unable to decide means "leave it alone", timing out gives the safe answer rather than the
// dangerous one: treating a live share as stale would unmount it out from under whatever is

// does not get to run fuse_main's unmount when a share is switched off. Left alone, the FUSE mount
// and its /storage bind stayed behind with nothing serving them and /storage/<name> remained
// visible to apps as a directory that failed every access, which is worse than the share simply
// being gone. gentle_kill in the .rc gives the daemon a chance to exit cleanly first; this is what
// makes the outcome certain.
//
// The retry loop is because "stop" is asynchronous: the process may still be alive on the first
// pass, and tearing down a mount that is about to be torn down cleanly is not something to rush.
